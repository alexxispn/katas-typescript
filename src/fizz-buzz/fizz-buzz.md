# FizzBuzz

The goal implement a method that accepts a number as input and prints a sequence of numbers from 1 to the given number, 
with certain replacements for specific multiples.

## Instructions

Write a program that follows these rules:

- Print the numbers from 1 to the given number.
- For multiples of 3, print "Fizz" instead of the number.
- For multiples of 5, print "Buzz" instead of the number.
- For numbers that are multiples of both 3 and 5, print "FizzBuzz" instead of the number.

## Examples

Here's how the **FizzBuzz** program should work when given the number 16 as input:

```
1
2
Fizz
4
Buzz
Fizz
7
8
Fizz
